## Combining IPv6 & Credential Relaying to Takeover a Domain Controller
For the final project of this module, I was given the task to write a report about a topic of my choice. As I've always been interested in Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation inside an Active Directory network, I decided to explore one of the many techniques to Takeover a Domain Controller.
The report can be found [here](CMP110-Report.pdf).
